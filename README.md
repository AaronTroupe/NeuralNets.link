Usage
To use the API, make a request to the appropriate endpoint with your API key and the model you want to use.
Example Request
curl -X POST \
  https://api.neuranets.link/v1/models/{model_id} \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {your_api_key}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "input": "your input data"
      }'


Replace {model_id} with the ID of the model you want to use.
Replace {your_api_key} with your actual API key.

Selecting a Model
Browse our model catalog or use our model search feature to select a model. Each model includes detailed information on capabilities, performance metrics, and usage examples.
Code Examples
Python Example
import requests

api_key = "your_api_key"
model_id = "model_id"
input_data = {"input": "your input data"}

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.post(
    f"https://api.neuranets.link/v1/models/{model_id}",
    headers=headers,
    json=input_data
)

print(response.json())

JavaScript Example
const api_key = "your_api_key";
const model_id = "model_id";
const input_data = { input: "your input data" };

fetch(`https://api.neuranets.link/v1/models/${model_id}`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${api_key}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(input_data)
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

Authentication
All API requests must be authenticated with your API key, obtainable from your account dashboard.

Keep your API key secret and do not share it.
Use HTTPS for all API requests to ensure security.
